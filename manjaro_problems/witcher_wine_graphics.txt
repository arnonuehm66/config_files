I just found the solution to the graphics glitch, quite by accident. Titan quest has an issue with some flickering textures and a workaround for that. Guess what, the same thing fixes the flickering issue for The Witcher! 

"HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Wine\Direct3D", add the String 
"CheckFloatConstants" with the value "enabled" 

I also set the Video memory size to 2048. 

Tested with WINE 1.9.18. Nothing more is needed for an (almost) perfect witcher experience. 


The only remaining glitch is some blank black textures in Vizima. I guess those are supposed to be puddles. No idea why they do not show properly, it is a very minor issue.
